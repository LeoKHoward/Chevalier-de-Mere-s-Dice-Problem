# Chevalier de Mere's Dice Problem

This project calculates the mean/variance/standard deviation of two games played 1,000,000 times each:
- throwing at least 1 six in 4 throws of a 6 sided die
- throwing at least 1 double 6 in 24 throws of two 6 sided dice

## Requirements

Any Java JDK (8+)

## Build & Test

To run, open [Main](src/Relax/Main.java) and click the green play button

This will then produce output for the two games, listing their mean chance of success, variance and standard deviation
